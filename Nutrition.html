        <p>Nutrition is the study of nutrients in food, how the body uses them, and the relationship between diet, health, and disease.
            <br> Nutritionists use ideas from molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics to understand how nutrients affect the human body.</P><br>
        <p>Nutrition is a critical part of health and development. Better nutrition is related to improved infant, child and maternal health, stronger immune systems, 
            safer pregnancy and childbirth, lower risk of non-communicable diseases (such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease), and longevity.</p><br
        <p>Healthy children learn better. People with adequate nutrition are more productive and can create opportunities to gradually break the cycles of poverty and 
            hunger.</p><br>

    <h2><font color="blue">TYPES OF NUTRITION</h2><br></font>
    <h4><font color="RED">AUTOTROPHIC NUTRITION :</h4></font>
    <P>The term autotrophic nutrition combines two terms, ‘auto’ meaning self and ‘trophic’ meaning nutrition. The organism falling under this category contains a 
        green pigment called chlorophyll which traps energy from the sunlight.Under this process, organisms prepare their own food from inorganic minerals such as 
        carbon dioxide, water, mineral salts, etc. Plants break down this food into glucose for survival. This entire process is called photosynthesis.
        nutrition is also a part of this nutrition mode where the organism synthesises organic food by chemical reaction. They use substrates like hydrogen sulphate, 
        iron, nitrate, etc., to break down the food. Nitrobacter, sulphur bacteria are examples of chemo-autotrophs.</P><br>
        <h4><font color="RED">HETROTROPHIC NUTRITION :</h4></font>
        <p>Heterotrophic organisms can not produce food independently and depend on animals and plants for their food source. 
            This group is divided into three categories depending on the choice of food and mode of feeding.Since humans follow a heterotrophic nutrition mode, 
            they depend on fruits, vegetables and meat to procure the essential nutrients. This is a primary reason why dieticians suggest consuming a nutritious meal.
