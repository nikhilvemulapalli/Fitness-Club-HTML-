" height="400" width="360"<br><p>Why it's a winner: Interval training boosts your fitness levels and burns 
more calories to help you lose weight. The basic idea is to vary the intensity within your workout, instead of going at a steady pace.<br>
How to: Whether you walk, run, dance, or do another cardio exercise, push up the pace for a minute or two. Then back off for 2 to 4 minutes. 
How long your interval should last depends on the length of your workout and how much recovery time you need. A trainer can fine-tune the pacing. 
Repeat the intervals throughout your workout.</p><hr></li>
